# MANC analysis scratchpads for Gautham et al.

Very sorry this is not in platinum grade research code format.

TODO:
- Proper install with `pip`/setuptools
- Direct figure panel production as independent scripts
- Tidy up notebooks
- One command or one-click production of figures, at least
in pre-Illustrator format.

Environment details are in manc.yaml.

To copy environment:

```
conda env create --file ENV_NAME.yaml
conda create -n ENV_NAME --file ENV_NAME.txt
```
